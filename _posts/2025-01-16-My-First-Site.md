When working with SQL to analyze and aggregate data, challenges often arise when dealing with NULL values, formatting results for readability, or maintaining numerical precision for calculations. In this post, we’ll address these common issues and demonstrate how to handle them effectively in SQL.

### 1. The Challenge: Calculating an Average Price
Imagine you’re tasked with calculating the average price of products based on their sales history. Your table contains columns for product prices, units sold, and purchase dates. A typical query might look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    product_id, 
    SUM(price * units) / SUM(units) AS average_price
FROM 
    Prices
JOIN 
    UnitsSold 
ON 
    Prices.product_id = UnitsSold.product_id 
GROUP BY 
    product_id;
```
While this query works in ideal cases, problems arise:
- NULL values: If no sales data exists for a product, the average_price returns NULL.
- Formatting: By default, SQL may return results with excessive decimal places.
- Data usability: Results with NULL may break downstream calculations or dashboards.
### 2. Solution: Handling NULL Values
To ensure that products without sales data default to an average price of 0, you can use the IFNULL or COALESCE function:

```sql
SELECT 
    product_id, 
    IFNULL(SUM(price * units) / SUM(units), 0) AS average_price
FROM 
    Prices
JOIN 
    UnitsSold 
ON 
    Prices.product_id = UnitsSold.product_id 
GROUP BY 
    product_id;
```
Here, IFNULL(expression, 0) replaces NULL with 0, ensuring consistency in the output.

### 3. Formatting with Precision
When presenting the results, it’s common to limit decimal places to improve readability. Use the ROUND function to control precision:

```sql
SELECT 
    product_id, 
    ROUND(SUM(price * units) / SUM(units), 2) AS average_price
FROM 
    Prices
JOIN 
    UnitsSold 
ON 
    Prices.product_id = UnitsSold.product_id 
GROUP BY 
    product_id;
```
This ensures the average_price has exactly two decimal places.

### 4. Combining Precision and NULL Handling
To handle both formatting and NULL replacement, you can combine ROUND with IFNULL or COALESCE:

```sql
SELECT 
    product_id, 
    IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(price * units) / SUM(units), 2), 0) AS average_price
FROM 
    Prices
JOIN 
    UnitsSold 
ON 
    Prices.product_id = UnitsSold.product_id 
GROUP BY 
    product_id;
```
With this query:
- The ROUND function ensures two decimal places.
- IFNULL replaces NULL values with 0.
# 5. Final Thoughts
These techniques ensure robust, user-friendly queries that handle edge cases gracefully. Whether building dashboards or running analytics, taking care of NULL values, precision, and formatting ensures your data remains actionable and reliable.
